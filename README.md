3. Make sure in ur backup-folder are no folders with a name including spaces.
4. If u want to pull all repositories in a subfolder rename it like this:

   subfoldername -> subfoldername.group
   
   This wont work recursivly so only for direct subfolders not for sub-subfolders!
5. Execute the script.
